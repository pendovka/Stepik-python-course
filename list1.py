# Print a table of size n√ón filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in 
# a spiral pattern, starting from the top left corner and spiraling 
# in a clockwise direction.

# Explanation: You are given a positive integer n. 
# Your task is to generate a square table with n rows and n columns. 
# The table should be filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in a spiral pattern, 
# starting from the top left corner and proceeding in a clockwise direction.
